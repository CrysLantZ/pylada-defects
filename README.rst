# pylada-defects
A computational framework to automate point defect calculations

About:

An open-source Python framework that automates point defects DFT calculations using VASP.\
 The high-throughput DFT calculations are performed using PyLada.
Framework automates the computation of point defect formation energies. It creates point \
defect structures (vacancies, interstitials, sustitutions) and provide open source tools \
to compute finite size corrections (1. potential alignment, 2. image-charge correction, 3\
. band-filling correction to shallow defects) with the supercell approach to calculate de\
fect formation energies.
